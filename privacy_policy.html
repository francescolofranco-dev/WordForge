    <h1>WordForge — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>WordForge is a vocabulary learning app that runs entirely on your device. Your privacy is simple: we don't collect, store, or transmit any of your data. Period.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data you enter into WordForge — words, meanings, progress, and statistics — is stored locally on your device using an on-device database. This data never leaves your phone.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>WordForge does not collect any personal information. We do not collect names, email addresses, location data, device identifiers, usage analytics, or any other personal data.</p>

    <h2>Network Access</h2>
    <p>WordForge does not require an internet connection and does not make any network requests. The app works entirely offline.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>WordForge does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>WordForge requests the following permission:</p>
    <p><strong>Notifications:</strong> Used to send you word review reminders at scheduled times. This permission is optional — the app works without it, but you won't receive reminders. No notification data is sent to any server.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete individual words or all words at any time from within the app. Uninstalling the app removes all stored data permanently.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>WordForge does not collect any data from anyone, including children. The app is safe for users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If this privacy policy is updated, the changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date. Since WordForge collects no data, meaningful changes are unlikely.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can reach out at: <strong>lofrancofrancesco@gmail.com</strong></p>
